#### About me
  I currently work at nuclear power plant as reactor operator and study at Netology fullstack python developer course. I started learning Python at university for scientific calculation (thermal conductivity and neutron physics) and now work on web-development. 
  
  I'm looking for a internship as python backend-developer. I'm ready for relocation or remote work.
